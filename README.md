# Learning-Overparametrized-Neural-Nets
Implementation of the neural network setup used by [Learning Overparameterized Neural Networks via
Stochastic Gradient Descent on Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01204.pdf) to prove the convergence of SGD

Originaly implemented and tested on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CPxHUiG7HpHAbAT6U_f_3qgXCpCMnT6G), the code is best utilized when viewed on Colab
